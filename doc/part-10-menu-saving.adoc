Now that our game is bursting with gameplay potential, we can think
about those little things that die-hard fans will surely miss during
their long playing sessions. One of the most important is, of course,
a save/load mechanism! This way they can go to sleep and dream about
your scary monsters between play sessions.

== Tidy initialization

To choose between continuing a previous game or starting a new one we
need a main menu. But wait: our initialization logic and game loop are
tightly bound, so they're not really prepared for these tasks. To
avoid code duplication, we need to break them down into meaningful
blocks (functions). We can then put them together to change between
the menu and the game, start new games or load them, and even go to
new dungeon levels. It's much easier than it sounds, so fear not!

Take a look at your initialization and game loop code, after all the
functions. I can identify 4 blocks:

* *System initialization* (initialising the tcod window and consoles)
* *Setting up a new game* (everything else except for the game loop
   and the FOV map creation)
* *Creating the FOV map*
* *Starting the game loop*

We can use these as the building blocks to make up the higher-level
tasks like loading the game or moving to a new level:

* *Create a new game*: set up the game, create FOV map, start game
   loop (this is what we have now).
* *Load game*: load data (we won't deal with this block just yet),
   create FOV map, start game loop.
* *Advance level*: set up new level (we won't deal with this yet
   either), create FOV map (the game loop is already running and will
   just continue).

Let's put everything from `main` except for the system initialisation
and the main loop into a `new_game` function:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
tag::new_game_header[]
fn new_game(tcod: &mut Tcod) -> (Game, Vec<Object>) {
end::new_game_header[]
include::part-5-combat.adoc[tag=create_player,indent=4]
include::part-6-going-berserk.adoc[tag=player_fighter_cb,indent=4]

include::part-5-combat.adoc[tag=create_objects_list,indent=4]

include::part-8-items.adoc[tag=game_init,indent=4]

tag::call_initialise_fov[]
    initialise_fov(tcod, &game.map);
end::call_initialise_fov[]

include::part-7-gui.adoc[tag=welcome_message,indent=4]

tag::new_game_return[]
    (game, objects)
end::new_game_return[]
}
----

We return a tuple with two elements: the vec of `Objects` and
the `Game` struct.

`new_game` is calling `initialise_fov` so we need to create it and move
the FOV-related code to it:

[source]
----
tag::initialise_fov_fn[]
fn initialise_fov(tcod: &mut Tcod, map: &Map) {
    // create the FOV map, according to the generated map
    for y in 0..MAP_HEIGHT {
        for x in 0..MAP_WIDTH {
            tcod.fov.set(
                x,
                y,
                !map[x as usize][y as usize].block_sight,
                !map[x as usize][y as usize].blocked,
            );
        }
    }
    end::initialise_fov_fn[]
}
----

Finally, the game loop and the few bits before it belong to their own
function as well:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
tag::play_game_header[]
fn play_game(tcod: &mut Tcod, game: &mut Game, objects: &mut Vec<Object>) {
end::play_game_header[]
include::part-4-fov-exploration.adoc[tag=init_previous_player_pos,indent=4]

include::part-1-graphics.adoc[tag=game_loop_while_header,indent=4]
include::part-2-object-map.adoc[tag=clear_offscreen_console,indent=8]

include::part-7-gui.adoc[tag=check_for_event,indent=8]

include::part-5-combat.adoc[tag=check_fov_recompute,indent=8]
tag::call_render_all[]
        render_all(tcod, game, &objects, fov_recompute);
end::call_render_all[]

include::part-1-graphics.adoc[tag=root_flush,indent=8]

include::part-7-gui.adoc[tag=previous_player_position,indent=8]
tag::call_handle_keys[]
        let player_action = handle_keys(tcod, game, objects);
end::call_handle_keys[]
        if player_action == PlayerAction::Exit {
            break;
        }

tag::monsters_take_turn[]
        // let monsters take their turn
        if objects[PLAYER].alive && player_action != PlayerAction::DidntTakeTurn {
            for id in 0..objects.len() {
                if objects[id].ai.is_some() {
                    ai_take_turn(id, tcod, game, objects);
                }
            }
        }
end::monsters_take_turn[]
    }
}
----

And now we just call `new_game` and `play_game` from our slimmed-down
`main` function:

[source]
----
fn main() {
include::part-1-graphics.adoc[tag=set_fps,indent=4]

include::part-1-graphics.adoc[tag=init,indent=4]

include::part-7-gui.adoc[tag=tcod_init,indent=4]

    let (mut game, mut objects) = new_game(&mut tcod);
    play_game(&mut tcod, &mut game, &mut objects);
}
----

`let (a, b) = some_tuple` is how we turn a tuple into its parts. We
have to put `mut` in front of each one so Rust lets us change them
later.

You can think of `let (mut a, mut b)` as two separate bindings: `let
mut a = ...` and `let mut b = ...`. Except since `new_game` returns a
tuple, we can't really have them as separate.


Anyway, the game should compile again and the setup code is more
modular. Which will come in handy in the coming sections.

== The main menu

:image: http://tomassedovic.github.io/tcod-rs/tcod/image/index.html

To keep our main menu from appearing a bit bland, it would be pretty
cool to show a neat background image below it. Fortunately, tcod lets
us {image}[load and display images]!

Since libtcod emulates a console, we can't directly show arbitrary
images, since we can't access the console's pixels. We can, however,
modify the background color of every console cell to match the color
of a pixel from the image. The downside is that the image will be in a
very low resolution.

:subcell: https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tcod/image.html#tcod.image.Image.blit

However, libtcod can do a neat trick: by using specialized characters,
and modifying both foreground and background colors, we can double the
resolution! This is called subcell resolution, and {subcell}[this page of the
docs] shows some images of the effect (at the end of the page).

:background: https://github.com/tomassedovic/roguelike-tutorial/blob/master/menu_background.png

This means that, for our 80x50 cells console, we need a 160x100 pixels
image. We'll be using the {background}[image from the original Python
tutorial].

[source]
----
tag::main_menu_setup[]
fn main_menu(tcod: &mut Tcod) {
    let img = tcod::image::Image::from_file("menu_background.png") // <1>
        .ok()
        .expect("Background image not found");  // <2>

    while !tcod.root.window_closed() {  // <3>
        // show the background image, at twice the regular console resolution
        tcod::image::blit_2x(&img, (0, 0), (-1, -1), &mut tcod.root, (0, 0));
end::main_menu_setup[]

tag::main_menu_show_options[]
        // show options and wait for the player's choice
        let choices = &["Play a new game", "Continue last game", "Quit"];
        let choice = menu("", choices, 24, &mut tcod.root);
end::main_menu_show_options[]

tag::main_menu_new_game_choice[]
        match choice {  // <4>
            Some(0) => {
                // new game
                let (mut game, mut objects) = new_game(tcod);
                play_game(tcod, &mut game, &mut objects);
            }
end::main_menu_new_game_choice[]
tag::main_menu_quit_game_choice[]
            Some(2) => {
                // quit
                break;
            }
            _ => {}  // <5>
        }
end::main_menu_quit_game_choice[]
    }
}
----
<1> Load the background image
<2> Exit if the loading failed
<3> Show the main menu in a loop -- this lets us play another game
after the current one ends
<4> Either start a new game or quit
<5> If the player selects anything else, keep showing the menu


Now replace the calls to `new_game` and `play_game` in `main` with:

[source]
----
tag::call_main_menu[]
main_menu(&mut tcod);
end::call_main_menu[]
----

If you try it out now, you'll see a nice menu with a dungeon-y
backdrop!

Now let's add the game's title and some credits. You'll probably want
to modify the values. Put this in the `main_menu` before calling the
`menu` function:

[source]
----
tag::main_menu_text[]
tcod.root.set_default_foreground(LIGHT_YELLOW);
tcod.root.print_ex(
    SCREEN_WIDTH / 2,
    SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2 - 4,
    BackgroundFlag::None,
    TextAlignment::Center,
    "TOMBS OF THE ANCIENT KINGS",
);
tcod.root.print_ex(
    SCREEN_WIDTH / 2,
    SCREEN_HEIGHT - 2,
    BackgroundFlag::None,
    TextAlignment::Center,
    "By Yours Truly",
);
end::main_menu_text[]
----

You'll notice that the menu rectangle starts with a blank line. That
is because the header string is empty, but `root.get_height_rect`
reports its height as `1` by default.

To make the line go away, we need to check that condition in the
`menu` function:

[source]
----
tag::menu_calculate_header[]
// calculate total height for the header (after auto-wrap) and one line per option
let header_height = if header.is_empty() {
    0
} else {
    root.get_height_rect(0, 0, width, SCREEN_HEIGHT, header)
};
let height = options.len() as i32 + header_height;
end::menu_calculate_header[]
----

Finally, when you start a game, go back to the main menu with Escape
and start another game results in a bug! Parts of the first game are
still visible in the second game. To fix that, we need to clear the
console.

At the end of `initialise_fov`:

[source]
----
tag::initialise_fov_con_clear[]
// unexplored areas start black (which is the default background color)
tcod.con.clear();
end::initialise_fov_con_clear[]
----

There it is, a neat main menu, and with only a handful of lines of code!


== Saving and loading

Storing a game state to disk (and then reloading it) is not
conceptually hard: You could imagine just taking all the data from our
`game` and `objects` variables and writing them to a file value by
value.

It would, however, be a huge hassle that would require a ton of code,
you'd need to define a way to structure the data in the file and
there's a good chance you'd get a lot of bugs at first.

Luckily, there are ways of automating most of this that make saving
and loading quite painless. Here's the teaser:

[source]
----
tag::save_game_fn[]
fn save_game(game: &Game, objects: &[Object]) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {  // <1>
    let save_data = serde_json::to_string(&(game, objects))?;  // <2>
    let mut file = File::create("savegame")?;  // <3>
    file.write_all(save_data.as_bytes())?;  // <4>
    Ok(())  // <5>
}
end::save_game_fn[]
----
<1> save `game` and `objects` -- they contain all our game state. The saving can fail so return a `Result` which could be `Ok` or `Err`
<2> convert both `objects` and `game` into json
<3> create a file called "savegame" -- that's where we'll write the
game state
<4> write the json-ified game state to the file
<5> if nothing went wrong return `Ok`, indicating success

:json: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

Don't mind the `?` operator at the end of the line for now, it's there for error handling and
we'll explain it in a bit.

The first line (`serde_json::to_string(&some_data)`) takes the data we
want to save (objects and the game state in our case) and turns it to
a {json}[JSON]-encoded String.

That functionality comes from the {serde}[serde and related crates] so
we need to add them to our `[dependencies]` in the `Cargo.toml` file
and we'll also enable the "serialization" feature in the _tcod_ crate:

[source,toml]
----
[dependencies]
tcod = { version = "0.15", features = ["serialization"] }
rand = "0.3"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
----

The `serde` crate provides the main functionality for serializing and
deserializing of Rust data. This includes the `Serialize` and
`Deserialize` traits which describe what to do for a given
struct/enum/whatever. The optional `derive` feature provides a way to *derive* those
traits so we don't need to implement them ourselves and finally
`serde_json` converts any serializable struct to and from JSON. If we
wanted to use a different format (YAML, TOML or anything else, we'd
replace this crate with another one that supports what you want).

Now let's add those traits our source code, including the `save_game`
function and try to compile:

[source]
----
tag::use_error[]
use std::error::Error;
end::use_error[]
tag::use_io[]
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{Read, Write};
end::use_io[]

tag::use_serde[]
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
end::use_serde[]
----

Unfortunately, the compilation will fail:

....

:serialize: https://docs.serde.rs/serde/trait.Serialize.html

Apparently, we need to implement {serialize}[the Serialize trait].
That tells Rust how to encode each bit of data in our structs. We can
do it manually, but it would be error-prone and *really tedious*.
Luckily, we can just use `#[derive(Serialize)]` and have Rust do it
for us!

[source]
----
#[derive(Serialize)]  // <1>
struct Game {
    map: Map,
    messages: Messages,
    inventory: Vec<Object>,
}
----
<1> The Game struct can be now serialised... sort of

If you try to compile it now, you'll see that the complaint has
shifted from `Game` to `Object`. We'll need to derive `Serialize`
for every struct and enum we'll be saving.

There is a complementary trait called `Deserialize` which goes the other way:
from a serialised representation to a struct.

So let's add them all at once:

[source]
----
tag::derive_serde_traits[]
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
end::derive_serde_traits[]
struct Messages {
    ...
}

include::part-10-menu-saving.adoc[tag=derive_serde_traits]
struct Game {
    ...
}

}

}

tag::derive_copy_eq_serde_traits[]
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
end::derive_copy_eq_serde_traits[]
struct Fighter {

end::derive_clone_eq_serde_traits[]
enum Ai {
    ...
}

include::part-10-menu-saving.adoc[tag=derive_copy_eq_serde_traits]
enum Item {
    ...
}
----

It's a bit of a bother but not the end of the world. After that, our
code should be compiling, though it will warn that `save_game` is not
actually called from anywhere. Let's fix that!

Traditionally, roguelikes only let you save when you're quitting the
game, so we'll call `save_game` in `play_game` right before the
`break` that ends the game:

[source]
----
tag::handle_player_action[]
if player_action == PlayerAction::Exit {
    save_game(game, objects).unwrap();
    break;
}
end::handle_player_action[]
----

If you run the game now and then quit it, you should see a new file
called `savegame` created. You can look inside it -- thanks to it
being JSON-encoded, it's actually somewhat readable. It will contain
all the objects and the entire game state.

But if we're not able to do anything with the save file, what use does
it have? We need to add a `load_game` function, too:

[source]
----
tag::load_game_fn[]
fn load_game() -> Result<(Game, Vec<Object>), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let mut json_save_state = String::new();
    let mut file = File::open("savegame")?;
    file.read_to_string(&mut json_save_state)?;
    let result = serde_json::from_str::<(Game, Vec<Object>)>(&json_save_state)?;
    Ok(result)
}
end::load_game_fn[]
----

It's basically just the reverse of `save_game`: we read the save file
contents to a String, then we decode it into our `objects` Vec and
`Game` struct and if it all succeeds, return the pair.

In `main_menu` we'll handle the load game choice now:

[source]
----
match choice {
    Some(0) => {  // new game ... }
    Some(1) => {
        // load game
        let (mut objects, mut game) = load_game().unwrap();
        initialise_fov(tcod, &game.map);
        play_game(&mut objects, &mut game, tcod);
    }
    Some(2) => {  // quit ...}
    _ => {}
}
----

To make things compile, you'll have to derive `Deserialize` to every
struct and enum that has the `Serialize` trait, too.

After that, you should be able to load a previously saved game and
continue playing!


But what if there is no game to load? Or if the file gets corrupted?
We haven't talked about error handling much, but now we need to.

:error-handling: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/error-handling.html

The Rust book has {error-handling}[a whole chapter on error handling]
so we'll do only a tiny introduction. You should read that chapter.

:result: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html
:option: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html

Both `save_game` and `load_game` return a `Result` value.
{result}[Result] is similar to {option}[Option] in that it has two
possibilities it can return -- one that usually indicates a success
and the other failure. But in `Result`'s case, the failure can have
associated data as well. The successful variant is called `Ok` and the
failure is `Err`.

:error: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html

There's also the {error}[Error trait] which represents an error and
lets you get its textual description. All the file-handling
serialisation errors in our save/load code implement Error.

So, looking at `save_game`, the `serde_json::to_string` call returns
either `Ok(String)` with the encoded value or
`Err(serde_json::error::Error)` on failure. `File::create` and the
`write_all` method work similarly although with different success and
error types.

Since we can return more then one error type, we return `Box<Error>`
instead. That lets us return any type that implements `Error` and the
caller can get at the description and the raw error if they want.

:?: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html?highlight=with,result#recoverable-errors-with--result

The {?}[? operator] is a convenient way of saying _"If this
failed, return from the function with error immediately, otherwise give me
the success value"_. The operator also does an extra conversion to the error
type specified in the functions return value.

So `let mut file = File::create("savegame")?;` is almost equivalent
to

[source]
----
fn save_game(game: &Game, objects: &[Object]) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
  ...
  let mut file = match File::create("savegame") {
      Ok(f) => f,
      Err(e) => return Err(e)
  };
  ...
}
----

Only difference is that the `?` operator also does the conversion of the error to
whatever Error type the calling function asks for. In our case, since we're using
`Box<Error>`, no conversion will actually be done.

So, that explains the `save/load game` functions. But what about using
their results?

If you tried to compile the game, you've seen this warning:

....
cargo build
   Compiling roguelike-tutorial v0.1.0 (file:///home/thomas/code/roguelike-tutorial)
src/bin/part-10-menu-saving.rs:1123:13: 1123:38 warning: unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default
src/bin/part-10-menu-saving.rs:1123             save_game(objects, game);
                                                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
....

It did not cause an error but Rust is being passive-aggressive about
how we're calling a function that can fail and then ignoring it.

:unwrap: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap

So, we can keep ignoring it, try to actually handle the error or
simply crash by calling {unwrap}[unwrap] :-)

Unwrap will make Rust happy that we've processed the Result, but it
will simply abort the program whenever we get `Err` back.

Replace the call to `save_game` with `save_game(objects,
game).unwrap()`.

You have to realise however, that if this ever happens, it will make
your users really unhappy. If `save_game` fails for any reason, your
game will just quit without any warning and the player will lose their
progress. You should always try to handle errors gracefully.


Let's do that when we load the game. Calling `load_game` right now
uses `unwrap` as well, so if there is no game to load or something
similar, we'll just quit the game.

We could just print a message and let the player start a new game instead:

[source]
----
tag::main_menu_load_game_choice[]
Some(1) => {
    // load game
    match load_game() {
        Ok((mut game, mut objects)) => {
            initialise_fov(tcod, &game.map);
            play_game(tcod, &mut game, &mut objects);
        }
        Err(_e) => {
            msgbox("\nNo saved game to load.\n", 24, &mut tcod.root);
            continue;
        }
    }
}
end::main_menu_load_game_choice[]
----

And we'll add a function to display messages that relies on `menu` to
do all the heavy lifting:

[source]
----
tag::msgbox_fn[]
fn msgbox(text: &str, width: i32, root: &mut Root) {
    let options: &[&str] = &[];
    menu(text, options, width, root);
}
end::msgbox_fn[]
----

And that's it! The actual saving and loading code was quite small, but
we had to learn a ton of new stuff to understand it.


Here's link:part-10-menu-saving.rs.txt[the complete code so far].
